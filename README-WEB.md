Forum user @CarnationREDmade this wonderful mod, but hasn't been around for over a year.  Original thread is here:  https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/192699-*

I've adopted it, fixed a small problem with file names and added a bunch of available texture files.

 

Changes

Fixed names of two part config files (no dot before cfg)    
Moved Texture folder into the PluginData folder to avoid KSP loading textures unnecessarily
